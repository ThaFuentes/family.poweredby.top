# ================================================================
# poweredbytop/__init__.py
# Full path: poweredbytop/__init__.py
# File name: __init__.py
# Purpose: Main package entry point and security gatekeeper for PoweredBy.Top
# Version: 2026-05-08-1 COMPLETE FRESH REBUILD
# Security classification: CRITICAL – every single request flows through this
# ================================================================
# DESIGN PRINCIPLES (non-negotiable):
# 1. This is the central hub that forces every request through the full security pipeline.
# 2. Auto-initializes all security components (tables + reputation + session hardening).
# 3. Zero tolerance for broken initialization — failures are logged but never crash the app.
# 4. Full compatibility with the new dynamic reputation model (positive_requests + negative_points).
# 5. Clean, minimal, production-ready, and 100% backward compatible.
